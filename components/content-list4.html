                        Our platform serves as a third-party credit risk
                        assessment tool designed to assist banks in evaluating
                        the financial credibility of their customers. Bank
                        employees enter borrower details into our system, and
                        our machine learning models process the data to generate
                        insights. The platform provides a loan default risk
                        score (expressed as a percentage), a recommended loan
                        amount that is deemed feasible for the specific
                        customer, and predictive analytics in both numerical and
                        graphical formats. These insights help banks in making
                        informed lending decisions and mitigating potential
                        financial risks. However, it is important to note that
                        our platform’s role is strictly advisory, and the final
                        lending decision remains entirely with the bank.

                        credit risk evaluation, and fair lending practices. Our
                        risk models are developed in accordance with RBI’s
                        Prudential Framework for Resolution of Stressed Assets
                        (June 2019) and other regulatory requirements concerning

                        ensure secure handling, processing, and storage of
                        customer financial data. If applicable, we also adhere
                        to the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) to guarantee
                        compliance with Indian data security standards. To
                        further enhance fair lending practices, our system is
                        designed to avoid biases that could lead to
                        discriminatory loan evaluations, as per RBI directives
                        on ethical lending.
